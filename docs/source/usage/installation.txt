Installation
============

.. _github: https://github.com/bjfar/JMCtf
.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
.. _anaconda: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html

The recommended way to install the package is from PyPI, i.e.::

    pip install jmctf

However this project is hosted on `github`_, so you can also clone the repository and install from that in the usual ways, e.g.::

    git clone https://github.com/bjfar/jmctf.git
    pip install ./jmctf

Even when installing from the git repo, it is still recommended to use `pip`_ since this is compatible with `anaconda`_ environments.

Once installed the package can be imported in Python using the module name :code:`jmctf`.
